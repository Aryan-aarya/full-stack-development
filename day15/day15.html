    <p>Pokémon[a] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games,
        animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media.
         The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon,
          a large variety of species endowed with special powers.
           The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[1] but it is known to attract people of all ages.</p>

    <p>Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure. Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[6][7] Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) subsidiary of TPC has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.[</p>

    <p>The contracted term Pokémon derives from a syllabic abbreviation of the franchise's full name, Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā). When the franchise began to be released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) for pronunciation.[9]</p>
